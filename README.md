Hi, I'm Nash. I'm a Junior Computer Science student at Texas A&M University and an aspiring Software Engineer who is passionate about software development and solving problems.

My experience at Texas A&M has been great so far, allowing me to learn crucial programming concepts that I've put to good use with various personal projects.

Some personal interests of mine are playing the piano and basketball, traveling to France, and watching tennis, Formula 1, and college football.
